***Title of the project:*** Student Support Services *(ongoing)*

**Project Summary:**

The *"Student Support Services"* project aims to create a comprehensive platform 
that empowers students with easy access to academic information and enhances 
their engagement with college events while offering a conversational interface 
through a chatbot for personalized assistance.

**Why do we need them?** In many colleges, the absence of a dedicated platform 
for assisting both staff and students in managing various aspects of academic life 
has led to the use of unconventional tools like WhatsApp. While WhatsApp 
serves as a communication channel, it falls short in providing a structured and 
comprehensive solution for addressing critical issues such as fees payment, 
access to academic information, and organized resources, as well as keeping the 
community informed about college activities.

The *"Student Support Services"* application emerges as a crucial solution to 
bridge this gap. Serving as an open-source platform, this application is designed 
to be adopted by educational institutions and organizations to streamline and 
enhance communication and resource management within the academic 
community.
